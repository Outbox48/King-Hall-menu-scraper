# King-Hall-menu-scraper
Script automation to populate the King hall meals from the spreadsheet online to the fitness spreadsheet
This will be accomplished by running the script on mondays and fridays and pulling new days menus off the google sheet posted online and adding and sorting them in the new sheet in my own drive
    to accomlish this I might have to switch to downloading them as an excel document
